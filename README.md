# Wiki
Using Swift's Natural Language library to connect Wikipedia pages

Make sure you initiate it with two arguments

## Installation:
- download or clone the repository
- open terminal and change directory into the repository
```
cd downloads/wiki
```
- run ./wikiApp \[start] \[end]

* Repository also includes iOS app, note that it runs much slower as the pathmaking takes place on the background thread to allow for live updates.

## Example:
```
./wikiApp Einstein Radiology
```
## Example response:

Einstein -> Radiology
1. Philosophy of psychiatry:   0.8062679767608643
2. Psychiatry:   0.637018620967865
3. Radiology:   0.0
